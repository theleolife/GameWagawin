# GameWagawin

I've read the description and requiriments of the task to figured out what I was about to build, as I have never done a game before I have to make a research about similiar examples of the game, I have used documentations, w3schools, Google, Youtube and tutorials, friends...etc

First step, I've created a function to split the image in parts numbered x until y, in case of our task it should 1 until 12, split the photo and divide in 4 colums and 3 rows.

The second step, create a function to move image's part in diferent direction.

Obs: I was making the game in a different way that the game should be, I was about to build a function that user's could moviment the parts while it was clicked on it and this would make the game harder for the users as it gives only 2 possiblity of moviments parts while drag and drop you can move wherever direction you want, anyway, after send a email to Chris about it, he gave me a faster feedback about it the game should be a drag and drop.

after that I've changed the function for a drag and drop, the game still needed a start to init start and randomly the parts, for that It was create a looping array using sorted function and mapping the parts of the image to matching it as I needed to rebuild/update the image to the normal state.

So, the logic behind It was about to split the image, drop and drag and mapping the parts, create a init start, create random then update and rebuild image to normal state.


What was the hardest part?

Create something new that I never been done, it was fun and hard. But probably I will use it in the future.

What could be improved? 

It could improve if it's rebuild the code and add some framework as react, angular, cordova or others to run in any diferent mobile, add more functionality as level, timer to complete the game and a better visual and usability.

As I have never been done it and I was quickly busy the last days, counting the time I start development and stop, start and stop...I think I spend around 9 - 11 hours.
